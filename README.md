## Overview

This repository is mainly for personal use but can be used as a basis for configurations on any mac or Linux machine for Vim and oh-my-zsh. As my configuration files grow and are updated I will use this repository to track their progress and use it as not only a point of restoration for my inevitable errors but also as a starting point for new hosts. 

## zShell

If oh-my-zsh is installed the specific themes and tools specified in the `.zshrc` file can be used. Simply run the init script in the `zsh` directory to install the theme and source the `zshrc`  config.

## Vim

Similar to zShell there is a init script in the `vim` directory. If run the `vimrc` and required packages will be installed. 

## iTerm

With iTerm installed the `.itermcolors` file can be imported as a theme and enabled within the preferences menu.
